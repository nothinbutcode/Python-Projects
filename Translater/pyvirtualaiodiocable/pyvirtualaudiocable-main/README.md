# PyVirtualAudioCable

Virtual Audio Cable made with Python.

## Pre-requisite knowledge

### What is a Virtual Audio Cable?

In very short - a software which captures input from one system source and routes it to a new virtual input/output depending on how you configure it. This allows the scope of manipulation of audio on the fly and serve modified audio as input to another software.

Imagine a software which changes your voice to chipmunk on your next Zoom Call.

### Why a Virtual Audio Cable using Python?

Because currently there are no good open source virtual audio cable implementations on the Internet. Also, the ones that exist are highly operating system specific and a need of a software that works everywhere is very comfortably handled by Python.
